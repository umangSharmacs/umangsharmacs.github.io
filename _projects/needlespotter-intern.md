## Overview

During my internship at NeedleSpotter Inc, I developed AI-powered systems for medical content generation, editing, and quality improvement through iterative model training and human feedback integration.

## Key Contributions

### End-to-End Dashboard Development
Built an end-to-end dashboard to fetch, display, and edit AI-generated tweets from medical literature with real-time modification capabilities.

### Multi-Stage Filtering System
Engineered a multi-stage filtering system leveraging scoring rubrics (clinical relevance, impact, journal quality) to pre-select PubMed articles for downstream LLM generation.

### Feedback Collection & RLHF Pipeline
Engineered a feedback collection system within the dashboard interface, capturing human edits and preferences for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) model improvement.

## Technical Details

**Technologies Used:** React, PHP, Python, LLMs, RAG, RLHF

## Results and Impact

- Developed a complete feedback loop system that enables continuous model improvement through human editorial input
- Created a flexible, persona-based content generation system that adapts tone and complexity for different medical audiences
- Established a scalable pipeline for processing medical literature and generating high-quality, clinically relevant content
