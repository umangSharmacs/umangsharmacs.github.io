## Overview

This computer vision project developed an autonomous camera system that can track basketball action and automatically zoom to follow the ball, with post-game analysis capabilities.

## Key Contributions

- Developed YOLOv11 model for basketball detection with CSRT tracking for continuous 30-frame ball tracking
