I am a Master's student at the University of Pennsylvania, specializing in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, with graduation expected in Spring 2026. I worked at ZS Associates, where I used Deep learning models such as DeepAR and TFT to predict market trends, forecast sales, and tackle supply challenges. I am passionate about solving real-world problems through technology, with a focus on machine learning, computer vision, and game analytics.
