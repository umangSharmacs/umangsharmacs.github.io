## Overview

During my internship at ZS Associates, I focused on building robust data infrastructure and implementing advanced analytics solutions. My work spanned ETL pipeline development, machine learning model deployment, API optimization, and Bayesian statistical modeling for market analysis.

## Key Contributions

- **ETL Workflow Automation**: Automated ETL workflows using Python and SQL, reducing data processing time by 30% and improving data reliability
- **CI/CD Integration**: Integrated CI/CD workflows for ML models using Docker and GitHub Actions, streamlining deployment and cutting debugging time by 40%
- **API Performance Enhancement**: Enhanced API performance for real-time data access, reducing response time and improving system scalability
- **Bayesian Regression Analysis**: Leveraged Bayesian regression models to analyze market trends, leading to a 27% increase in budget allocation efficiency

## Technical Details

### ETL Pipeline Development
Designed and implemented automated ETL workflows that processed large-scale datasets efficiently. Utilized Python for data transformation logic and SQL for optimized database operations, incorporating error handling and data validation to ensure reliability.

### ML Model Deployment Infrastructure
Built comprehensive CI/CD pipelines for machine learning models using Docker for containerization and GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment. This infrastructure ensured consistent model versioning and rapid iteration cycles.

### API Optimization
Refactored existing API endpoints to handle concurrent requests more efficiently, implementing caching strategies and query optimization techniques that significantly reduced response times for real-time data access.

### Bayesian Regression Modeling
Applied Bayesian regression techniques to analyze complex market trends, incorporating prior knowledge and uncertainty quantification to provide more robust predictions for budget allocation decisions.

## Results and Impact

- Reduced data processing time by 30% through automated ETL workflows
- Improved data reliability and consistency across analytics pipelines
- Cut model debugging and deployment time by 40% with CI/CD integration
- Enhanced system scalability and API response times for real-time applications
- Increased budget allocation efficiency by 27% through advanced statistical modeling
- Established best practices for ML model deployment that were adopted team-wide
