## Overview

As a Research Assistant at the University of Pennsylvania, I work on email classification and behavioral pattern analysis using state-of-the-art NLP models, focusing on detecting advice-seeking and gossip patterns in workplace communication.

## Key Contributions

### RoBERTa-Based Binary Classifier
Engineered a RoBERTa-based binary classifier for advice-seeking and gossip detection in emails, achieving an 81% F1 score, automating manual classification and increasing processing speed by 5x.

### Large-Scale Email Classification
Automated classification for 200,000+ emails, reducing manual workload by 80% and enabling large-scale behavioral pattern analysis.

### Behavioral Pattern Discovery
Discovered correlations between gossip frequency and advice-seeking interactions, leading to data-driven policy recommendations on workplace communication strategies.

## Technical Details

**Technologies Used:** RoBERTa, T5, Python, NLP, Machine Learning

The project involved fine-tuning RoBERTa for binary classification tasks and developing a multi-class classification pipeline using T5 models. The system processes large volumes of email data to identify patterns in workplace communication.

## Results and Impact

- Achieved 81% F1 score on advice-seeking and gossip detection tasks
- Increased processing speed by 5x and reduced manual workload by 80% through automation
- Processed 200,000+ emails for large-scale analysis
- Generated actionable insights on workplace communication patterns that informed policy recommendations
